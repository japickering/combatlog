## Combat log project for an action RPG game

### Features
Outputs simple combat text from player data in a text field. 
I plan to extend it even further with better filtering. 

## Installation
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To run the project git clone the repo to a local directory then Run the console commands into a terminal:
```bash
cd gameoflife
npm install
npm start
```
To create a new build for deployment run the console command then follow the steps to run the server on a port of your choice:
```bash
yarn build
```
